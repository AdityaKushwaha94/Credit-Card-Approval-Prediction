# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a credit card application will be approved or denied based on various applicant features and historical credit records. The model is trained using XGBoost, a popular gradient boosting algorithm, to classify applicants as either "approved" or "denied" based on their risk profile.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a reliable credit card approval prediction model that can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding credit card applications. The dataset consists of two primary components:

1. **Application Record**: Contains information about the applicant, including income, family size, and other demographic data.
2. **Credit Record**: Contains the applicant's historical credit behavior, which is used to calculate a "risk score" that contributes to the prediction.

## Features

- **AMT_INCOME_TOTAL**: Total annual income of the applicant.
- **CNT_CHILDREN**: Number of children the applicant has.
- **CNT_FAM_MEMBERS**: Number of family members.
- **Age**: Age of the applicant.
- **Years_Employed**: Number of years the applicant has been employed.
- **Risk_Score**: A calculated risk score based on the applicant's credit history.
- **Categorical Features**: Includes gender, car ownership, education type, family status, and more.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction.git
   cd Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the datasets application_record.csv and credit_record.csv in the project directory.

How to Run
After setting up the project, you can run the code by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
python credit_card_approval.py
This will train the XGBoost model and output the accuracy and classification report on the test set.

Model Tuning
The model is trained using a grid search (or randomized search) to find the best hyperparameters for the XGBoost classifier. You can adjust the hyperparameters in the param_grid section of the script to experiment with different configurations.

Results
The model achieves a high accuracy in predicting credit card approvals based on the historical data provided. The classification report gives detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score for both classes (approved/denied).
